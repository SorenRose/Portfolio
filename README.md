# Portfolio
High School/College Projects
This Github repoisitory contains most of my personal work from my high school/college years.

Most of these files required BlueJ 4.0 in order to run succesfully, the version from roughly 2016-2018.  The version that only contains web apps does not work, unfortunately.

With that said, the files are all still readable and the coding completely done by me, and will still give a good idea of my style and capabilities.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to my e-mail which is also on my resume.  Thank you for taking the time to check my portfolio and anything else you may look at of mine.
